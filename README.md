## Preface

> Selfless dedication is not a fantasy. Sometimes, we can do it.

## Naming

> The story goes like this:
>
> Since Microsoft announced the news of the `.NET 5` platform, I have been thinking about developing a development framework based on the `.NET 5` platform. I wants to be the first to eat the `.NET 5` crab.
>
> At the beginning, I thought of `Lazier` as the name of the framework, which means `更懒` in Chinese. In line with my "all simple, just to be lazy" development philosophy.
>
> But **Lazier** and **Worse** have similar pronunciation and no characteristics, and the meaning is not very good. I have been agonizing about the name change for several days.
>
> Just once in QQ group accidentally brush to chat record hair **`Furion [fu:rɪən]`** word, meaning is a prophet, at that moment, recognized it!
>
> `Furion` means "prophet" in Chinese, which is just in line with my original intention of creating the framework. So, `Furion` was born.

## About Logo

`Furion`'s logo design concept is based on [The Famous Kangaroo Theory](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%A2%8B%E9%BC%A0%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA).

Kangaroo has the characteristics of **long legs, bagging and self running**.

- `Long legs`: It means that `Furion` has steady legs, walks in the forefront of science and technology, goes further and runs faster.
- `Brood bag`: Small bags and big achievements. It is expected that `Furion` can breed more. Net excellent developers and vibrant ecology.
- `Self run`: `Furion` itself should keep learning, making progress, innovating and developing.
